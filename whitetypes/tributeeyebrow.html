        <h2>‿̩͙⊱༒︎━━━━━━﹙History and Origin﹚━━━━━━༒︎⊰‿̩͙</h2>
        <p id="part1">
        <div class="another-title"> Imperial Tribute Heritage </div>
        Tribute Eyebrow has its origins in the royal tea traditions of China's Fujian Province, where it was historically produced as a tribute tea for imperial courts and high-ranking officials. The name "Gong Mei" literally translates to "Tribute Eyebrow," reflecting both its status as a tea worthy of offering to nobility and the distinctive curved shape of its leaves that resemble elegant eyebrows. This imperial connection established Tribute Eyebrow's reputation as a tea of refinement and distinction.

        <div class="another-title">Scholarly Appreciation</div>
        During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Tribute Eyebrow became particularly popular among scholars and literati who appreciated its balanced character and elegant appearance. The tea was often served during scholarly gatherings, poetry sessions, and philosophical discussions, where its subtle complexity provided inspiration without overwhelming the senses. This association with intellectual pursuits helped cement Tribute Eyebrow's reputation as a tea for contemplation and refined appreciation.

        <div class="another-title">Regional Development</div>
        Like other white teas, authentic Tribute Eyebrow comes primarily from the Fuding and Zhenghe regions of Fujian, where specific microclimates and tea cultivars create its unique character. Over centuries, tea masters in these regions refined the production methods for Tribute Eyebrow, developing the precise balance of leaf selection and processing that defines this tea. The regional variations between Fuding and Zhenghe styles created subtle differences that connoisseurs still appreciate today.

        <div class="another-title">Modern Renaissance</div>
        While Tribute Eyebrow was always valued in China, its international recognition grew significantly in the late 20th century as global tea enthusiasts discovered white teas beyond Silver Needle. The tea's perfect balance of accessibility and sophistication made it particularly appealing to those seeking white tea's health benefits and delicate character without the premium price of Silver Needle. Today, Tribute Eyebrow enjoys renewed appreciation as both a daily luxury and a tea for special occasions.
        </p>
        <h2>‿̩͙⊱༒︎━━━━━━﹙Production Process﹚━━━━━━༒︎⊰‿̩͙</h2>
        <p id="part2">
        <div class="another-title">Precision Leaf Selection</div>
        Tribute Eyebrow is made from carefully selected young leaves and buds, typically following a "one bud with one or two leaves" standard that creates its characteristic balance. The leaves are harvested during the prime spring season, with timing crucial to achieving the perfect maturity level. The buds provide sweetness and delicacy, while the young leaves contribute body and complexity. This careful selection ensures the tea has both elegance and substance.

        <div class="another-title">Artisanal Withering</div>
        The freshly plucked leaves undergo careful withering on bamboo trays in well-ventilated areas. The withering process for Tribute Eyebrow is typically 48-60 hours, allowing gradual moisture loss and minimal enzymatic development that creates the tea's signature flavor profile. The leaves are carefully turned and monitored to ensure even withering without bruising. This artisanal approach requires experience and attention to detail to achieve the perfect balance of flavors.

        <div class="another-title">Solar Influence</div>
        Traditional Tribute Eyebrow production often includes controlled solar withering, where the leaves spend specific periods in gentle sunlight. This solar exposure helps develop the tea's characteristic honey and floral notes while maintaining its delicate character. The balance between solar and indoor withering is precisely managed by experienced tea masters who understand how to maximize flavor development without compromising the tea's elegance.

        <div class="another-title">Gentle Final Processing </div>
        After withering, the tea undergoes very light drying at low temperatures to preserve its delicate compounds and aromas. Unlike some white teas that may be compressed, Tribute Eyebrow is typically kept as loose leaf to maintain its elegant appearance. The final sorting removes any stems or imperfect leaves, ensuring a consistent, high-quality product. The finished tea should show a beautiful mix of silvery buds and greenish-silver leaves with the characteristic curved shape.

        <h2>‿̩͙⊱༒︎━━━━━━﹙Traditional Brewing Methods﹚━━━━━━༒︎⊰‿̩͙</h2>
        <p id="part6">
        <div class="another-title">Precision Temperature Control</div>
        Tribute Eyebrow brews best with water at 80-85°C (176-185°F), a temperature range that extracts its full complexity while preserving delicate aromas. The water should be high-quality spring water or filtered water to avoid mineral interference. Many experts bring water to a boil then let it cool for 2-3 minutes before use. The precise temperature control is essential for appreciating the tea's sophisticated balance of flavors.

        <div class="another-title">Glass Teaware Appreciation</div>
        Tribute Eyebrow is beautifully showcased in glass teaware, which allows observation of the elegant leaves unfurling and the tea's lovely color development. Glass gaiwans or teapots enable full appreciation of the brewing process, while glass cups display the tea's pale golden hue. The transparency enhances the sensory experience, making the preparation as aesthetically pleasing as the drinking.

        <div class="another-title">Western Style Elegance</div>
        For Western preparation, use 2-3 grams of Tribute Eyebrow per 200ml of water at 80-85°C, steeped for 3-5 minutes. This method produces a well-balanced cup that showcases the tea's sophistication. The tea can tolerate some variation in steeping time without becoming bitter, making it forgiving for those still developing their brewing skills. It should be enjoyed without additions to appreciate its natural elegance.

        <div class="another-title">Gongfu Method Refinement</div>
        The Gongfu method works exquisitely with Tribute Eyebrow, allowing full appreciation of its evolving complexity. Use 4-5 grams in a 150ml gaiwan with 85°C water, starting with 30-45 second steeps and increasing gradually. This method reveals the tea's remarkable range through multiple infusions, with each steep highlighting different aspects of its character. The transformation through successive brews is particularly educational and enjoyable.

        <div class="another-title">Multiple Infusion Mastery</div>
        High-quality Tribute Eyebrow can yield 5-7 excellent infusions when properly brewed:<br> <br>

        First infusion (2-3 minutes): Delicate floral and honey notes<br>

        Second infusion (3-4 minutes): Fuller body and fruit characteristics<br>

        Third infusion (4-5 minutes): Complex balance of all elements<br>

        Fourth+ infusions (5-6 minutes): Subtle sweetness and mineral notes<br>

        The tea's ability to maintain character through multiple infusions demonstrates its quality.
